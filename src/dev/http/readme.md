# HAR

It's tempted to dump http requests as HAR format.
However, it seems not suitable for REPL development workflow.

While working with HTTP requests in REPL, I usually want to view the body and the headers.
The tools that support HAR, for ex. HAR Viewer, needs a lot of clicks and efforts.

I should spend the effort somewhere else. For ex, HttpRequest viewer support for Portal.
